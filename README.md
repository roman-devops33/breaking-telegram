# breaking-telegram
Simple PoC script that allows you to exploit telegram's "send with timer" feature by saving any media sent with this functionality.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Due to Telegram API Terms of Service, the use of this script is for PoC only.
> 1.4. It is forbidden to interfere with the basic functionality of Telegram. This includes but is not limited to: making actions on behalf of the user without the user's knowledge and consent, **preventing self-destructing content from disappearing**, preventing last seen and online statuses from being displayed correctly, tampering with the 'read' statuses of messages (e.g. implementing a 'ghost mode'), preventing typing statuses from being sent/displayed, etc.

## How to
### Step 0 

`git clone https://github.com/matteounitn/breaking-telegram.git`

### Step 1

- Go to https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps;
- Create an app(doesn't matter how do you call it);
- Get API ID and API KEYS;
- Go to <https://replit.com/@dashezup/generate-pyrogram-session-string>;
- Get sesion string

### Step 2

1. `cd breaking-telegram`
2. `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python3 broke.py`

Now insert your number and your code. 

Eventually you will be asked for a password, if you have one set in your account.

### Step 3

Receive an image with timer (could also be a video or gif).
Check your saved messages.


## Take Home

Use secret chats. 
They're not bulletproof, but they're definitely safer.
